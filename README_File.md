> We are given various numerical & categorical variables (independent variables) and a target variable 'cnt'. We have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes i.e. 'cnt' variable.

## General Information
- I have build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Our goal is to identify a few top predictor variables which can help the company to make their strategies accordingly.
- I am using 'day.csv' files which have some numeric variable & some categorical variable

## Conclusions
- The company should focus on these top three parameters which positively impacts our target variable 'cnt'
  - yr
  - temp
  - winter
- The company should also focus on these top three parameters which negatively impacts our target variable 'cnt'
  - Light_Snow
  - Windspeed
  - Spring

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn
